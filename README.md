# Just Another Text Editor

## Description 

Here we have a full stack text editor app. It features the Progressive Web App paradigm, to allow for faster loading time, offline use, and local installation. Several NPM packaged are used including Express, Webpack, and Babel. Deployment is through Heroku, but can also start up from the back end. Webpack has bundled JavaScript files, this reduces the number of server request for optimization and allows the app to be installed locally. An HTML file, service worker, and  manifest file are generated by the Webpack Plugins. Text is then stored in an IndexedDb and is retrieved if the app is closed. Babel translates next-gen JavaScript, so that older browsers can understand.
